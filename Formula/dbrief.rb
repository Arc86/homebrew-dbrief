# Homebrew formula for dBrief — builds from source on the user's Mac.
#
# Building locally means the resulting app is never quarantined, so macOS
# Gatekeeper does not block it (dBrief is distributed outside the Apple
# Developer Program and is therefore unsigned/un-notarized).
#
# To publish: copy this file into a tap repo `Arc86/homebrew-dbrief` at
# `Formula/dbrief.rb`, then users run:
#
#     brew install Arc86/dbrief/dbrief
#
# After tagging a release, update `url` and `sha256` for the new version:
#
#     curl -L -o /tmp/dbrief.tar.gz \
#       https://github.com/Arc86/dBrief/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz
#     shasum -a 256 /tmp/dbrief.tar.gz
#

    <<~EOS
      dBrief was compiled locally and installed to:
        #{opt_prefix}/dBrief.app

      Because it was built on this machine, macOS Gatekeeper will not block it.
      To make it appear in /Applications and Launchpad, symlink it:
        ln -sf "#{opt_prefix}/dBrief.app" /Applications/dBrief.app

      Optional: `yt-dlp` enables transcribing YouTube / video URLs.
